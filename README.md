# SAF-LEP

SAF-LEP is a project aiming to provide a low-entropy protocol for secure indistinguishable by means of DPI
protocol, using different methods of data obfuscation without increasing the data's entropy too much.

Sacrificing the bandwidth for stability :D

# Protocol

Low entropy data is embedded into the lower bits of each byte of the data packet.
