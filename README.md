# SAF-LEP

SAF-LEP is a project aiming to provide a low-entropy protocol 
for "secure" `af` connection indistinguishable from some common UDP data by means of `Deep Packet Inspection`.

# Protocol

Low entropy data is embedded into the lower bits of each byte of the data packet.

Yada-yada ...

Description will be there once the protocol gets kinda-stable and/or embeded into custom
VPN software.
